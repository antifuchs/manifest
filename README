Manifest is a sytem for semi-automatically documenting Common Lisp
pacakges. (A manifest tells you what's in a package. Also this system
makes manifest a bunch of information that is actually present in a
Lisp system.) The basic premise is that every exported symbol in a
package should be documented.
